                OUR STORY
            </h1>

            <p>
                In west Philadelphia born and raised
                On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
                When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
            </p>

            <p>
                I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
                She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
                I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
            </p>
            <p>
                First class, yo this is bad
                Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
                Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                Hmm this might be alright.
