                <p>
                    David and Kelly met in 2018 on campus at Western Washington University. 
                    Kelly was DJ’ing at the radio station when David wandered in. 
                    Their first date consisted of talking about getting Frostys at Wendy’s, 
                    driving out to the Wendy’s, and sitting in the Wendy’s parking lot too 
                    wrapped up in conversation to get out of the car and actually get the 
                    frozen treats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Kelly and David first met, they both had crazy busy lives. David 
                    was working in Lynden and working on his computer science degree at Western. 
                    Kelly was working two jobs and studying for her Bachelor's degree in English 
                    Literature. Between speeding from work to school to home and back it was
                    difficult at first for Kelly and David to find the time to meet up for ‘real
                    dates.’ For their first few months, Kelly was working night shifts cocktailing 
                    and usually would get off around 2am. David would usually meet Kelly halfway
                    between his house and hers in the parking lot of one of the local gas
                    stations where they would sit in their car, share music, and talk until
                    late hours of the night or until one of them had to speed off to class the
                    next morning. This would go on night after night for months. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    David eventually left Western to pursue a job in his field, 
                    while Kelly left one of her two jobs to focus more on school. 
                    With these changes, they had more time to spend together, go 
                    on more dates, and further their relationships. One day splashing 
                    around in the ocean under the docks, an “I love you” slipped out. 
                    Nearly a year later in the pouring rain, on the way to a fun packed 
                    weekend of events in Seattle, David pulled over in that same 
                    parking lot between the two houses and got down on one knee. 
                    They spent their first weekend together as an engaged couple touring 
                    the space needle, museums, going on cruises, and wandering around 
                    the city together. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the time that followed, Kelly and David moved out of their parents’
                     homes to their first apartment downtown. The two live on the main hub 
                     street in Bellingham, WA in 700sq ft where the two are constantly learning
                      more and more about one another. They have also adopted two cats since then which they consider their fur-babies; Blancis and Fritz. Kelly recently graduated with her Bachelor’s 
                      and is now working on her Secondary Education Teaching certificate, 
                      David is working on game development projects in his free time, and 
                      the two are planning a wedding and life together in the craziness of 
                      the world today.
